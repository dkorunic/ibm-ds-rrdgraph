INFO:
This is a simple IBM Disk Storage System RRD grapher for any DS which uses
IBM System Storage DS Storage Manager, versions from 10 above. You'll need
rrdtool, configured Storage Manager and SMcli in either your $PATH or
SMcli path changed in script itself.

Results from script are self-obvious, RRDs are trivial to display and
manipulate from any existing PHP classes or Python modules.
